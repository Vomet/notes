When we talk about differentiating related functions, we're essentially looking at two functions that are connected in some way, and we want to understand how changes in one function affect the other.<br>For example, let's consider two related functions: position and velocity. Imagine you have a car moving along a straight road. The position function tells you where the car is at any given time, and the velocity function tells you how fast the car is moving.<br>Now, if you want to differentiate these related functions, you're figuring out how the car's position changes with respect to time and how its velocity changes. In simpler terms, you're answering questions like "Where is the car now?" and "How fast is it moving?"<br>In summary, differentiating related functions is like exploring the dynamic relationship between two quantities and understanding how one influences the other through the lens of calculus.<br><br>To differentiate between related functions:<br>
<br>List your knowns and unknowns
<br>Implicitly differentiate with respect to .
<br>If needed, find the unknown variable.
<br>Plug in all the variables to the implicitly differentiated equation found in step 1

Integration is like adding up many small parts to find the whole.<br>This means finding the area under a curve or the total value of something that varies continuously. This could be the area under a graph, the total distance traveled by an object with changing speed, or even the total amount of something over time.<br>There are two main types of integration:<br>
<br>Definite: a range of values is specified. This also means we're trying to find the area of a curve over a certain area.
<br>Indefinite: we're trying to find the antiderivative of the graph. In other words, we're trying to find a possible line whose slope is our original graph.
<br>If you're using indefinite integration, don't forget to add  at the end. This just tells you that the resulting graph can be moved up or down.<br><br>All integrals start with  and end with . Additionally, indefinite integrals also need  at the end (to show that the integral could be anywhere on the  axis).<br><br>Power Rule Tip

<br><br>If you noticed from <a data-href="#Basic Integrals" href="about:blank#Basic_Integrals" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Basic Integrals</a>, there are no product rules or quotient rules like those found in <a data-href="Derivative Rules" href="ap-calculus-notes/derivative-rules.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Derivative Rules</a>. So, if you encounter an integral where there is multiplication or division, you need to rewrite it so that all terms are being added by one another.<br>Example
Rewrite .
This is easy. Use the FOIL method so that no term is being multiplied.

Next, rewrite the integral:

Now, you can integrate!
<br>Other methods of rewriting include:<br>

<br>If needed, draw an image to visualize what it looks like.
<br>If you have more than one variable, express all other variables as a function of . In other words, figure out what the variable equals with respect to .

<br>Test the points you found in the previous with the second derivative () to determine concavity. This determines what you'll plug in for step 5.

<br>When , it is a maximum
<br>When , it is a minimum


<br>Plug your desired values from step 4 into . Find the absolute maximum or minimum, depending on what you're optimizing for.
<br>Optimization problems can vary in terms of what the problem is asking, but these steps should work for most of them.<br>Example 1
An open-topped rectangular prism with a square base has a volume of . What is the minimum possible surface area?
Step 1
Find the equation.
Our aquarium is a rectangular prism with an open top.
The volume of a rectangular prism is:<br>

And since the volume must be equal to :<br>

 because the base is a square. So, substituting those for  in gives us:<br>

Now, let's find our area. We know the following:

<br>Our figure is a rectangular prism. The area of a rectangular prism is: 
<br>The prism doesn't have a top, which means there is only one side equal to . The new area equation is now: 
<br> (which are our bases). This means our area equation is now: 

Putting it all together, our area formula is:<br>

Before optimizing , we need to find all variables in terms of . We don't know what  is, but we need to find it in terms of . Luckily, the volume formula gives us the best shot at finding this:<br>

Now, plug  into :<br>


Step 2
Find .<br>


Step 3
Find the critical points for .<br>

 does not have any points that do not exist, so we need to find when :<br>

Multiply both sides by  to get:<br>

Optionally, you can figure out what the height equals too:<br>


Step 4
Check the concavity to verify that  is a minimum.
First find .<br>

Now plug in :<br>

, so it's concave up. This means  is a minimum for .

Step 5
Find the absolute minimum.
In step 3, we found that  was a critical value. In step 4, we verified that it was a minimum. Now, we will plug it into  to find the minimum value.


Answer
The minimum possible area for the exterior is . To get that, the length and width must equal  and the height must equal .

<br><br>We have a sheet of metal that is  and we want to fold each side in a certain distance such that we get the most volume out of it.<br><br>Given that, this is what our equation looks like:<br><br>Note that  because a box cannot have negative volume.<br><br>Derive the above to get:<br><br><br>We need to use the quadratic formula to figure out when .

 <br><br>Main hardware components:<br>
<br>CPU

<br>Control Unit: retrieves and decodes instructions. Coordinates activities on computer
<br>Arithmetic &amp; Logic Unit: dos high-speed numeric calculations as well as True/False


<br>Main memory (also known as RAM): Volatile memory. Erased when computer is turned off. All bytes are identified by a number called an "address"
<br>Secondary memory: non-volatile. Data is stored even if computer is turned off
<br>Input devices: sends info from outside to the computer
<br>Output devices: sends info from computer to the outside
<br>Programs are instructions that tell the computer to do a task. Algorithms are set of well-defined steps<br>Machine language instructions are binary numbers that tell the computer to do something. Instead of writing just 1's and 0's, programmers use programming languages<br>Programming languages can be either low-level or high-level. Lower level languages are closer to the machine language. Higher-level languages are closer to human language.<br>To translate from high-level program to executable:<br>
<br>Create program
<br>Run preprocessor to convert source file to source code
<br>Run compiler to convert source program code to machine instructions
<br>Run linker to connect hardware-specific code to machine instructions. Creates executable file
<br>IDEs are tools used to write, compile, and debug programs all in one place.<br>Programming langauge elements<br>
<br>Key words: words with special meaning in C++. Examples include using, int, return
<br>Programmer-defined identifiers: names made by programmer. It can be used to represent variables, functions, etc.
<br>Operators: performs operations on data
<br>Punctuation: marks end of statement or separates items in a list
<br>Syntax: how program should be written
<br>Variable: holds data
<br>To declare (make) a variable:<br>double hours;

// You can declare multiple in one line too!
double rate, pay;
Copy<br>Programming process<br>
<br>Define what program will do
<br>Visualize it running on the coputer
<br>Use design tools to create a model of the program
<br>Check model for logical errors
<br>Type code. Compile it.
<br>Correct any errors.
<br>Run program with test data
<br>Correct any errors. Repeat steps 5-8 as many times as necessary
<br>Validate results
<br>Procedural programming: focuses on process. Procedures/functions are written to process data<br>Object-oriented programming: focuses on data and ways to manipulate it]]></description><link>cop-2220-introduction-to-c++/01-intro-to-computers-and-programming-cop-2220.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">COP 2220 - Introduction to C++/01 Intro to Computers and Programming - COP 2220.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 17:11:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[02 Intro to C++]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Copy<br>Namespaces organize the names of program entities.<br>// Grabs the namespace called "std".
using namespace std;
Copy<br>Functions are used to group several statements together.<br>// Note that the data type of what the function returns must be stated too
int main()
{
	cout &lt;&lt; "This is inside a function!\n";
	cout &lt;&lt; "You can put in multiple lines and do multiple things inside one function!"
	return 0;
}
Copy<br><br>Warning
This section uses strings. Please include #include &lt;string&gt; at the beginning of your program to use strings.
<br>cout is an object that displays output on the computer screen. For instance<br>// To use cout, you need to have these 3 lines:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

// cout must also be inside a function too
int main()
{
	cout &lt;&lt; "Hello world!";
}
Copy<br>would display Hello world! on the screen.<br>You can also send more than one item to cout too.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

// cout must also be inside a function too
int main()
{
	cout &lt;&lt; "Hello" &lt;&lt; "world";
	
	// Or, you could do this too
	cout &lt;&lt; "Hello ";
	cout &lt;&lt; "world";
}
Copy<br>cout only outputs one line to the screen. To create a new line use endl or add \n in a string<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout &lt;&lt; "Hello" &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "world" &lt;&lt; endl;

  /* Outputs:
  Hello
  world
  */

  // You can use \n too
  cout &lt;&lt; "Hello\n";
  cout &lt;&lt; "world";

  /* Outputs:
  Hello
  world
  */
}

Copy<br>You can even print with variables.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int number = 5;
	cout &lt;&lt; "Number: " &lt;&lt; number;
}
Copy<br><br>#include inserts the contents of another file into the program. It is a preprocessor, so it's not part of C++. Do not put a ;.<br>For example, if you put in<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
Copy<br>You are telling C++ to get a header file called iostream (which allows you to display stuff on the screen via cout).<br><br>Variables store stuff. They need a name and a type of data to hold. They also must be defined before they are used.<br>Here's an example:<br>int item;
Copy<br>Literals are values written into the code. For instance "hello world" is a string literal and 12 could be an integer literal.<br><br>Identifiers is a programmer-defined name for some part of a program. Includes variables, functions, and more! These names should represent what the variable, function, or whatever does.<br>Naming rules for identifiers:<br>
<br>First character must be a letter or an underscore
<br>Use distinct names
<br>No special characters
<br>Key words are reserved words in C++ that cannot used as identifiers.<br><br>Variables of the same type can be defined on the same lines, if you want.<br>int length, width;

int length;
int width;

// Both do the same thing.
Copy<br>To assign variables, use the equals sign or enclose it in parentheses<br>int width;
width = 12; // Assigns 12 to width

// You can also initialize (assign a value when the variable is defined)
int length = 12;

// You can initialize multiple on one line too
int depth = 13, height = 2, area;

// Parentheses method
int num(5);
int num{5}; // in C++ 11 or higher. This will check if `5` is an int or not.
Copy<br><br>There are two different types of numbers: integers and floats.<br>ints store whole numbers. But, you can make them store other numbers too.<br>// all the different integer types.
int num;
short num;
long num;
long long num;
Copy<br>Numbers are stored as ints by default, if they are whole numbers. You can change this by appending L to the number. This might arise if you've defined a variable as something other than an int and you assign it an integer.<br>int num;
num = 8;

// You can also choose to store them as "long" by appending L
num = 8L;

// Or, store as "long long" with LL
num = 8LL;

// Constants that begin with '0' are base 8
num = 075

// Constants that begin wtih '0x' are base 16
num = 0x75AB
Copy<br>Integers can also be unsigned. This means they can only store positive values. To do this, add unsigned before the data type.<br><br>Floating points can hold decimals as well as whole numbers. They are all stored in a form similar to scientific notation and are signed too.<br>There are 3 types: float, double, and long double.<br><br>long double is as big as or bigger than double; double is as big as or bigger than float.<br>float number;
number = 31.4;

// You can also use E notation too
number = 3.14E1;
number = 3.14e1;

// You can also force numbers to be a long double or float too
number = 31.4f // float
number = 31.4L // long double
Copy<br>Warning
If you're trying to assign a float to an int variable, the fractional part will be discarded.
<br><br>Holds a single character or integer. They must be enclosed in single quotation marks (').<br>char letter;
letter = 'C';

// Warning! This will not work!
letter = "C";
Copy<br>Strings also hold characters. They must be enclosed with "". You also need to put #include &lt;string&gt; too.<br>#include &lt;string&gt; // Required if you want to use strings

// Define string with "string"
string name;
name = "Bob";
Copy<br>When strings are stored in a computer's memory, they have \0 appended to them. The \0 is called the "null terminator" and it signifies the end of a string.<br><br>Booleans are either true or false. To use them in C++, use bool.<br>bool finished;
finished = false;
Copy<br><br>sizeof() tells you how big a data type or variable is.<br>double price;
cout &lt;&lt; "Memory size: " &lt;&lt; sizeof(price)
cout &lt;&lt; "Double size: " &lt;&lt; sizeof(double)
Copy<br><br>auto tells the compiler to determine the variable's data type automatically based on the initialization value. It works for all data types.<br>auto price = 30; // Turns into an int
auto letter = 'D'; // Turns into a char
Copy<br><br>Named constant (aka "constant variable") has data that cannot be changed during execution. They are usually written in uppercase letters.<br>const char GREETING = 'Hello';
Copy<br><br>Scope: part of program where a variable can be accessed. Variables can't be used before they are defined.<br><br><br>A special note on division. If you divide two integers, you get back an integer. This can be problematic because there are situations where dividing two integers and gives a float instead. For example, you might . But, in C++,  would equal  if both terms were integers. To solve this, make one of the numbers into a float.<br>Here's a program to show you the differences:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout &lt;&lt; "This is what 5/2 looks like when you:" &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "\tDivide by two integers: " &lt;&lt; 5 / 2 &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "\tDivide by at least one float: " &lt;&lt; 5 / 2.0;
  return 0;
}

  area = height * width;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Area: " &lt;&lt; area;
}
Copy<br><br>Math can be done as a variable, cout, or other statements.<br>All math in C++ follows the <a data-href="Order of Operations" href="Order of Operations" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Order of Operations</a>.<br>Here's how to do common math expressions:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt; // Required for exponents.
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int a = 5;
  int b = 3;

  cout &lt;&lt; "A: " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "B: " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; endl;

  cout &lt;&lt; "Addition: " &lt;&lt; a + b &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Subtraction: " &lt;&lt; a - b &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Multiplication: " &lt;&lt; a * b &lt;&lt; endl;
  
  // static_cast&lt;float&gt;(a) sets `a` to a float
  cout &lt;&lt; "Division (with floats): " &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;float&gt;(a) / b &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Modulus: " &lt;&lt; a % b &lt;&lt; endl;

  // Exponents require #include &lt;cmath&gt;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Exponents (A^B): " &lt;&lt; pow (a, b);
}
Copy<br><br>Hierarchy of number types in C++ (ranked by highest number they can hold; higher numbers first):<br>
<br>long double
<br>double
<br>float
<br>unsigned long
<br>long
<br>unsigned int
<br>int
<br>Type coercion: automatically converting one operand to another data type<br>
<br>Promotion: converting the operand to a higher data type
<br>Demotion: converting the operand to a lower data type
<br>Rules of coercion:<br>
<br>char, short, unsigned short are automatically promoted to int
<br>When operating on values of different data types, the lower one is promoted to the type of the higher one.
<br>When using the = operator, the expression on the right will be converted to the left expression's type
<br><br>Variables can only store a set range of values. If a number goes outside this range, the number "wraps" around. For example, if the maximum value is 1000 and the minimum is 0 and you get a value like -1, it will "wrap around" and give you 1000.<br>Overflow vs. underflow:<br>
<br>Overflow is when the assigned value is too big
<br>Underflow is when the assigned value is too small
<br><br>Type casting manually changes a data's type. This can be useful, especially when dividing.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int pay = 10;
  int hours_worked = 4;

  // This will give you the correct answer: 2.5
  cout &lt;&lt; "Hourly Wage: " &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;float&gt;(pay) / hours_worked &lt;&lt; endl;

  // Other methods. static_cast is still preferred
  cout &lt;&lt; float(pay) / hours_worked &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; (float)pay / hours_worked &lt;&lt; endl;
  
  // Bear in mind though that this will give you 2.0. It divides to give 2, then turns 2 into a float
  cout &lt;&lt; static_cast&lt;float&gt;(pay / hours_worked)
}
Copy<br><br>You can assign multiple variables to one variable.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
// Makes x, y, and z equal 5
x = y = z = 5;

cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; y &lt;&lt; endl;
cout &lt;&lt; z &lt;&lt; endl;
Copy<br>Combined assignment is where you take a variable and perform some operation with another number to itself. Usually, they look like this:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main ()
{
	int x = 5;
	
	// Adding 4 to x
	x = x + 4;
	x += 4;
	
	cout &lt;&lt; x;
	
	// Subtracts 3 from x
	x = x - 3;
	x -= 3;
	
	// Multiply x by 10
	x = x * 10;
	x *= 10;
	
	// Divide x by 5
	x = x / 5;
	x /= 5;
	
	// Finds remainder after dividing x by 7
	x = x % 7;
	x %= 7;
}
Copy<br><br>The iomanip header file helps you control how data is outputted. For example, you can use it to output only a certain number of decimal points.<br><br>setw() lets you set a fixed minimum number of characters for your output. This is useful if you want to make tables.<br>For example, this program<br>#include &lt;iomanip&gt; // Required for setw()
#include &lt;iostream&gt; // Required for displaying output

int main ()
{
	int value = 42;
	cout &lt;&lt; "[" &lt;&lt; setw(5) &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; "]";
}
Copy<br>outputs<br>[   42]
Copy<br>Notice that there are 3 spaces between [ and 42. This is because 42 only has 2 characters and requires 3 spaces for it to have 5 characters in total.<br>If the value in setw() is less than the output, no spaces will be outputted.<br>For example, this program<br>#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main ()
{
	int value = 12345;
	cout &lt;&lt; "[" &lt;&lt; setw(3) &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; "]";
}
Copy<br>outputs<br>[12345]
Copy<br><br>setprecision() rounds your output to a certain number of significant figures.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
using namespace std;

int main () {
	float pi = 3.14159265
	cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(5) &lt;&lt; pi &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(4) &lt;&lt; pi &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(3) &lt;&lt; pi &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(2) &lt;&lt; pi &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; setprecision(1) &lt;&lt; pi &lt;&lt; endl;
}
Copy<br>outputs<br>3.1416
3.142
3.14
3.1
3
Copy<br>It's important to note that setprecision(x) outputs x-1 significant figures.<br><br>fixed forces cout to print a certain number of digits.<br><br>showpoint shows trailing zeroes if there aren't enough significat figures in the decimal<br><br>The problem with using cin is that it ignores things like spaces and tabs. To fix this, use getline(). It reads an entire line of input.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string name;
  string city;

  // Now you can input your first and last name.
  cout &lt;&lt; "Name: ";
  getline(cin, name);
  
  // You can input city names with spaces
  cout &lt;&lt; "\nCity: ";
  getline(cin, city);
  
  cout &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; city;
}
Copy<br>cin.get() will read the next character. This is useful if you want to make a program say "Enter a key to continue."<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

char ch;  
cout &lt;&lt; "Strike any key to continue";  
cin &gt;&gt; ch;

// cin can also be set to ignore characters
cin.ignore(); // ignore next character
int x = 3;
cin.ignore(x, '\n'); // ignore `x` number of characters or until a '\n' is received
Copy<br>Strings<br>// Find length of string
string state = "Texas";  
int size = state.length();

// Concatenation
string city = "Austin";
string country = "USA";

string location = city + state;
string location += country;
Copy<br>setw() sets the width for output. It will add additional spaces if your variable doesn't have enough characters. If there are too many, it will cut some off.<br>cin.ignore() ignores the next character that is pressed. cin.ignore(x) ignores the next x characters that are pressed.<br><br>cmath is a library that helps you do math. Use #include &lt;cmath&gt; to use it.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;

int main() {
    // Calculate square root
    double num = 25.0;
    double sqrtResult = std::sqrt(num);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Square root of " &lt;&lt; num &lt;&lt; " is: " &lt;&lt; sqrtResult &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    // Calculate sine
    double angleInDegrees = 45.0;
    double angleInRadians = angleInDegrees * M_PI / 180.0; // Convert degrees to radians
    double sineResult = std::sin(angleInRadians);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Sine of " &lt;&lt; angleInDegrees &lt;&lt; " degrees is: " &lt;&lt; sineResult &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    // Calculate logarithm
    double logValue = 100.0;
    double logResult = std::log10(logValue);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Logarithm base 10 of " &lt;&lt; logValue &lt;&lt; " is: " &lt;&lt; logResult &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
Copy<br>&lt;cstdlib&gt; contains functions for random numbers and &lt;ctime&gt; contains functions for time.<br><br>Act like you're a computer executing the program. Take things step-by-step.

Last modified: 2024-01-28 12:30:40<br><br><br>[TOC]<br>In C++, if statements are written like this:<br>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int number = 80;
int minimum;

if (number &gt; minimum)
{
	cout &lt;&lt; "You have more than the minimum";
}
else if (number &lt; minimum)
{
	cout &lt;&lt; "You do not meet the minimum requirement.";
}
else if (number == minimum)
{
	cout &lt;&lt; "You have the same amount as the minimum";
}
else
{
	cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a valid number.";
}

// If the if statement only spans one line, you don't have to use curly braces
if (number &gt; 0)
	cout &lt;&lt; "Number is greater than zero."
Copy<br>If statements can be shortened using conditional operators. The basic format is<br>test_expression ? run_if_true : run_if_false
Copy<br>For example, the if statement and conditional operator below are equivalent.<br>#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int number = 3;

if (number &gt; 0)
	cout &lt;&lt; "Positive.";
else
	cout &lt;&lt; "Negative.";

number &gt; 0 ? cout &lt;&lt; "Positive." : cout &lt;&lt; "Negative."
Copy<br>Basic logic (ordered by precedence).<br>
<br>! gives you NOT logic. Reverse boolean value. True becomes False and vice versa
<br>&amp;&amp; gives you AND logic. Both conditions must be true.
<br>|| gives you OR logic. Either condition can be true.
<br>char and string type variables can be compared based on the total ASCII values that each character has. For example, if you have a string called "Mark", C++ will add up each character's value on the ASCII table.<br>Flags signal if a condition exists.<br>
<br>If it equals 0, it is false. This tells us that something is missing.
<br>All other values output true. This tells us that something exists there.
<br>switch can also be used instead of if/else if. switch compares the expression inside its parentheses with the list of cases that it has. If no matching value is found, it uses default.<br>If a value is the same, it executes the code inside the case block. It will continue running this until it runs into break. If no break is found at the end of a case block, it will move onto the next until it finds break.<br>break is used to exit the switch statement.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main() {
    char grade;

    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Enter your grade (A, B, C, D, or F): ";
    std::cin &gt;&gt; grade;

    switch (grade) {
        case 'A':
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Excellent! Keep up the good work.";
            break;
        case 'B':
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Good job! You're doing well.";
            break;
        case 'C':
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Not bad. Room for improvement.";
            break;
        case 'D':
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "You need to work harder.";
            break;
        case 'F':
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Uh-oh, you failed. Time to study more.";
            break;
        default: // Optional, but recommended.
            std::cout &lt;&lt; "Invalid grade entered.";
    }

    return 0;
}
Copy<br>switch is best for menu-driven programs. Menu-driven programs<br>
<br>display a menu
<br>get the user's input
<br>use the input as an expression in switch
<br>compare the expression to all case blocks
<br>Scope<br>
<br>variables inside { } have a local or block scope
<br>when inside a block of another block, you can define variables of the same name as the outer block

<br>the outer definition is not available whilst inside the inner block
<br>not a good idea

<br>return type
<br>name of function
<br>parameter list
<br>body
<br>To define a function in C++:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// If you don't want to return anything, use `void`
void function (parameters) {
  cout &lt;&lt; "Currently inside another function.";
}

// This function is called `main`
// It returns an `int`
// `int main` is a function header
int main (parameters) {
  int num = 3;
  return num;
}
Copy<br>Remember to define it before main().<br>Calling a function:<br>int function () {
  int num = 2;
  return num;
}

function();
Copy<br><br>Lets the compiler know about a function before calling the function.<br>It's best to place prototypes near the beginning of the file.<br>Prototypes require the return type of the function, the function name, and any parameters the function has.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Function prototypes. This lets compiler know that `function` exists.
void function();

int main () {
  cout &lt;&lt; "Calling the first function" &lt;&lt; endl;
  function(); // Calling `function`
}

void function () {
  cout &lt;&lt; "Function has been called" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
Copy<br>These are ideal if you defined a function below main().<br><br>Arguments send data into a function when it is called. Arguments are sometimes called "actual parameter" or "actual argument".<br>The variables that hold this data for a function are called parameters. Parameters are sometimes called "formal parameter" or "formal argument."<br>int main () {
  // 2 and 3 are passed in as arguments.
  multiply(2, 3);
}

int multiply (int a, int b) {
  // a and b are "parameters"
  return a * b
}
Copy<br>Prototypes must declare the data type of a parameter.<br>void prototype(int);

// For multiple arguments
void prototype(int, char, string);
Copy<br><br>Pass by value: when arguments are passed into a function, values are copied into its parameter.<br>Example:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Prototype of even_or_odd
int even_or_odd(int)

int main () {
  int val = 3;
  
  // val is passed in as an argument
  even_or_odd(val);
}

int even_or_odd(int num) {
  // num is an parameter. even_or_odd can change num, but not val
  return num % 2;
}
Copy<br><br>return can end the execution of a function if nothing is listed. Any lines of code after return are not executed.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main () {
  cout &lt;&lt; "Hello!" &lt;&lt; endl;
  return; // Stops the function here
  
  cout &lt;&lt; "This will not be displayed because it's below the return line";
}
Copy<br>return can also output whatever is ordered to. Additionally, the result of a function can be assigned to a variable.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main () {
  int num_1 = 3;
  int num_2 = 2;
  
  sum = add(num_1, num_2);
  cout &lt;&lt; sum;
}

int sum (int val_1, int val_2) {
  // Outputs the sum of val_1 and val_2
  return val_1 + val_2;
}
Copy<br>Booleans can be returned too. Just make sure the function outputs true or false.<br><br>Variables defined inside a function are local to that function. They stay inside the function.<br>This means functions can share variable names and not have any problems.<br>The "lifetime" of a variable is the part of code where a variable exists.<br>Global variables can be accessed by all functions. Their scope is the start of when they are defined all the way until a program ends.<br>
<br>Heavily discouraged because it makes debugging hard
<br>Globals should ideally be global constants (meaning, their values don't change)
<br>Automatically initialize to 0 or NULL.

<br>Local variables are not automatically initialized. They must be manually initialized.


<br>Define them outside of functions.
<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

// Global constants
const int GLOBAL = 34;

int main () {
  std::cout &lt;&lt; GLOBAL * 3;
}
Copy<br><br>Normally, when functions terminates, the contents of a variable are deleted.<br>static local variables retain their contents between function calls. They are defined and initialized when the function is first called. They keep this value once the function ends.<br>
<br>Cannot be called in other functions
<br>0 is the default initialization value
<br>When contents are retained between function calls, we say they "persist."<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

void incrementAndPrint() {
    // Static local variable persists between function calls
    static int count = 0;
    
    // Increment the static local variable
    count++;
    
    // Print the value of the static local variable
    std::cout &lt;&lt; "Count is: " &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}

int main() {
    // Call the function multiple times
    incrementAndPrint(); // Output: Count is: 1
    incrementAndPrint(); // Output: Count is: 2
    incrementAndPrint(); // Output: Count is: 3
    
    return 0;
}
Copy<br><br>Default arguments are values assigned to a parameter automatically if none are specified.<br>Default arguments can be declared in prototypes or inside the function header.<br>Here's an example of default arguments in a function header.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Function with default arguments
void greet(string name = "Guest", string greeting = "Hello") {
    cout &lt;&lt; greeting &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "!" &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int main() {
    // Calling the function without any arguments
    greet(); // Output: Hello, Guest!

    // Calling the function with one argument
    greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!

    // Calling the function with both arguments
    greet("Bob", "Good morning"); // Output: Good morning, Bob!

    return 0;
}
Copy<br>If greet() doesn't have any arguments passed in, it will use string name = "Guest" and string greeting = "Hello" as its default parameters.<br>And another example where the default arguments are in the prototype.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Function prototype with default arguments
void greet(string name = "Guest", string greeting = "Hello");

int main() {
    // Calling the function without any arguments
    greet(); // Output: Hello, Guest!

    // Calling the function with one argument
    greet("Alice"); // Output: Hello, Alice!

    // Calling the function with both arguments
    greet("Bob", "Good morning"); // Output: Good morning, Bob!

    return 0;
}

// Function definition with default arguments
void greet(string name, string greeting) {
    cout &lt;&lt; greeting &lt;&lt; ", " &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; "!" &lt;&lt; endl;
}
Copy<br>Default arguments come with some rules.<br>
<br>Define default arguments last.
<br>If an argument is omitted, all other arguments after must be omitted too.
<br>// Define default arguments last!
void greet(string greeting, string name = "Guest"); // OK
void greet(string name = "Guest", string greeting); // NOT OK

// Arguments after omitted argument must be gone too
greet("Hello", "User", "1234"); // OK
greet("Hello", , "1234");       // NOT OK
Copy<br><br>Reference variables are an alias for another variable. They are defined with an ampersand (&amp;). Once defined, you no longer need to include an &amp;.<br>Once a reference variable is initialized, they cannot be changed to refer to another variable. They always refer to the variable they were initialized with.<br>You can use it just like the original variable. Any changes made to the reference variable will affect the original variable, and vice versa.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main () {
	int y = 20;
	int &amp;ref_y = y; // Reference variable referring to y
	
	ref_y = 30; // This changes the value of y to 30
	std::cout &lt;&lt; y;  // Output will be 30
}
Copy<br>Reference variables are often used in function parameters to allow functions to modify the values of variables outside the function's scope without making a copy of the variable. This makes functions more efficient.<br>
<br>Remember, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="6.5 Pass by Value" data-href="#6.5 Pass by Value" href="about:blank#6.5_Pass_by_Value" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">pass by</a> copies the variable and stores it as a function parameter.
<br>For example:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

void increment(int &amp;num) { 
  // Notice how we don't need to return num too
  num++;
}

int main() {
  int z = 5;
  increment(z); // z will be modified to 6.
  cout &lt;&lt; z;    // Output will be 6
  return 0;
}
Copy<br>If you wanted that same output using <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="6.5 Pass by Value" data-href="#6.5 Pass by Value" href="about:blank#6.5_Pass_by_Value" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">pass by</a>, you would have to do this instead:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int increment(int num) {
    num++; // Increment the local copy of num
    return num;
}

int main() {
    int z = 5;
    y = increment(z); // z will remain unchanged because pass-by-value creates a copy
    
    cout &lt;&lt; z;    // Output will be 5
    cout &lt;&lt; y;    // Output will be 6
    return 0;
}
Copy<br><br>Function overloading in C++ refers to the ability to define multiple functions with the same name but with different parameter lists. These functions can have the same name but perform different tasks based on the number or types of parameters they accept.<br>This is helpful if you have a function that needs to do different things based on the input parameters, but you still want them to share a name.<br><br>Here's an example program where you can calculate the area of different shapes.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

// Function to calculate the area of a square
double calculateArea(double sideLength) {
    return sideLength * sideLength;
}

// Function to calculate the area of a rectangle
double calculateArea(double length, double width) {
    return length * width;
}

int main() {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Area of square with side length 5: " &lt;&lt; calculateArea(5.0) &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; "Area of rectangle with length 4 and width 6: " &lt;&lt; calculateArea(4.0, 6.0) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return 0;
}
Copy<br>As you can see, calculateArea can calculate the area of a square and a rectangle depending on how many parameters you give it. <br>
<br>If you give it one double, it will give you the area of a square. 
<br>If you give it two doubles, it will give you the area of a rectangle.
<br><br>Here's another example where the type of data you give affects the function used:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

// Overloaded function to display a string
void displayMessage(string message) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Message: " &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt; endl;
}

// Overloaded function to display a character
void displayMessage(char character) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Character: " &lt;&lt; character &lt;&lt; endl;
}

// Overloaded function to display an integer
void displayMessage(int number) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "Number: " &lt;&lt; number &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int main() {
    displayMessage("Hello, world!"); // Displays a message
    displayMessage('A');             // Displays a character
    displayMessage(123);             // Displays a number
    return 0;
}
Copy<br>displayMessage is able to adapt to different types of data and output whatever is needed.<br>
<br>Inputting a string outputs Message:
<br>Inputting a char outputs Character:
<br>Inputting an int outputs Number:
<br><br>exit() terminates the program. You can also pass an int to tell the user what caused the program to exit.<br>Typically, exit() is used if the program ends for a weird reason.<br>exit() requires cstdlib header file (put #include &lt;cstdlib&gt; at the beginning).<br>Examples<br>exit(0);

exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); // Indicates successful exit
exit(EXIT_FAILURE); // Indicates failed exit
Copy<br><br>Stubs and drivers are useful for testing and debugging functions.<br>
<br>Stub: a dummy function used in place of another. It displays a message indicating that the function was called as well as parameters
<br>Driver: a function that tests another function by calling it. It can pass in arguments and test return values.

Copy<br>The memory size of an array is (number of elements) * (size of each element).<br>In the example above, numbers would take up 20 bytes because 5 items with 4 bytes each gives you 20.<br>Size declarators are constants that set the size of an array. They make the maintenance of a program easier in the future.<br>const int SIZE = 5;  
int array[SIZE];
Copy<br><br>Every element of an array has a subscript. The subscript tells you where an element is in an array.<br>Subscripts start at 0. To access the first item, use array[0] where array is the name of the array.<br>This also means the last element is  elements away (where  is the number of elements in a list).<br>Elements in an array can be used just like variables. However, to use an array, you must access its elements.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int array[5];

array[0] = 0;
array[1] = 2;

// This will work
std::cout &lt;&lt; array[1];

// This will not work
std::cout &lt;&lt; array;
Copy<br>By default,<br>
<br>global array elements are initialized to 0.
<br>local array elements are uninitialized
<br>You can also initialize arrays with an initialization list (things you want to assign to an array as soon as it's defined). The number of elements in an initialization list must be less than or equal to the number of elements in the array.<br>// Array is initialized with the
// initialization list of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
int array[5] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// This will not work. invalid doesn't have enough space
int invalid[2] = {0, 1, 2};

// This will assign the first 3 values and set the rest to 0
int unassigned[5] = {0, 1, 2};
Copy<br>Array sizes can be implicitly determined by the size of an initialization list.<br>// implicitSize will have an implicit size of 6 because it's given 6 items.
int implicitSize[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Copy<br>char type arrays can have strings passed into them. They are the only type of array that allows you to not use {}.<br>char name[20] = "Bob";
Copy<br>However, I discourage using char arrays. It's better to work with strings instead.<br>Warning
When using arrays, C++ does not check if the subscript you use is within its range. You can use subscripts outside of an array's range, but doing so may cause issues in your program.
<br>Here's an example of C++ not checking outside its range.<br>outOfBounds[2] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
Copy<br>outOfBounds is only given 2 spaces in memory, but it has to store 5 items. So, to fix this, the program will overwrite memory spaces that may be used for other purposes. This will likely cause issues in the program.<br><br>Range-based for loops allow you to loop over all elements in an array. This decreases the likelihood of going out of bounds.<br>The general syntax is<br>for (dataType rangeVariable : array)  
	statement;
Copy<br>Here's an example:<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main () {
  int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

  for (int &amp;i : numbers) {
    i++; // Adds one to each element in the list.
    cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
}
Copy<br><br>To copy one array to another:<br>int newArray[3]
int array[3] = {0, 1, 2};

// Don't do this
newArray = array;

// Do this instead
for (int i : array)  
	newArray[i] = array[i];
Copy<br>If you don't know how big an array will be, make the array large enough to hold the largest expected number of elements. Additionally, track how many items are in that array.<br><br>Parallel arrays are two or more arrays that contain related information to one another. Typically, they're related by their subscripts.<br>In this example, studentNames correspond with studentScores.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    const int SIZE = 5;

    // Arrays to store student names and their corresponding scores
    string studentNames[SIZE] = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"};
    int studentScores[SIZE] = {85, 90, 75, 88, 92};

    // Displaying the student names and scores
    cout &lt;&lt; "Student Names and Scores:" &lt;&lt; endl;
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; SIZE; ++i) {
        cout &lt;&lt; studentNames[i] &lt;&lt; ": " &lt;&lt; studentScores[i] &lt;&lt; endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
Copy<br><br>To pass an array to a function, just use the array name:  <br>void showScores (scores[]) {
	for (int score : scores) {
		cout &lt;&lt; score &lt;&lt; "\t";
	}
}

int tests[3] = {80, 90, 100};
showScores(tests);
Copy<br>To define a function that takes an array parameter, use an empty [] for array argument:<br>// function prototype  
void showScores(int []);  

// function header  
void showScores(int tests[]) {
	;
}
Copy<br>It's common for you to also pass in the array size as an argument. This lets the function know how big to make the array.<br>Arrays in functions are like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="06 Functions - COP 2220 > 6.13 Reference Variables" data-href="06 Functions - COP 2220#6.13 Reference Variables" href="cop-2220-introduction-to-c++/06-functions-cop-2220.html#6.13_Reference_Variables" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">reference variables</a>. Any changes made to an array inside a function are also reflected outside the function.<br><br>Arrays can have multiple sets inside them.<br>const int ROWS = 3, COLS = 5;

// Create an array with 3 rows and 5 columns
int table[ROWS][COLS];

// To access anything inside table, you need to use 2 subscripts
table[1][2];

// You can also access an array of data by just accessing one subscript
table[1];

// You can even specify a third dimension
int third_dimension = [ROWS][COLS][3];

// Like normal arrays, you can leave [] empty for a non-specific number of elements in an array
int anyLength = [][][];
Copy<br>Use nested for loops to loop over elements of the inner array.<br><br>STL vectors, also known as C++ vectors, are dynamic arrays provided by the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. They are a sequence container that encapsulates dynamic arrays.<br>Unlike built-in arrays, which have a fixed size, vectors can resize themselves automatically when needed.<br>To use, make sure you have #include &lt;vector&gt; in your code.<br>This code snippet tells you more about what vector can do.<br>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Declare a vector to hold int elements
    vector&lt;int&gt; scores;

    // Declare a vector with initial size 30
    vector&lt;int&gt; scoresSize30(30);

    // Declare a vector and initialize all elements to 0
    vector&lt;int&gt; scoresInitialized(30, 0);

    // Declare a vector initialized to size and contents of another vector
    vector&lt;int&gt; finals(scoresInitialized);

    // Initialize a vector with a list of values (C++11 or later)
    vector&lt;int&gt; numbers { 10, 20, 30, 40 };

    // Add elements to the scores vector using push_back
    scores.push_back(75);

    // Access elements of a vector using at(i)
    cout &lt;&lt; "Element at position 2: " &lt;&lt; scores.at(2) &lt;&lt; endl;

    // Determine the capacity of the scores vector
    int maxElements = scores.capacity();
    cout &lt;&lt; "Maximum elements a vector can store without allocating more memory: " &lt;&lt; maxElements &lt;&lt; endl;

It will check the first value, then the second, then the third, and so on until the end of the array.<br>On average, it will require  searches for  number of elements in a list.<br>int linearSearch(int arr[], int size, int value)

Copy<br><br>
<br>Initialization: Binary search starts with the entire array and two pointers: one pointing to the beginning (left) and one pointing to the end (right) of the array.
<br>Midpoint Calculation: It calculates the midpoint of the array by averaging the indices of the left and right pointers: mid = (left + right) / 2.
<br>Comparison: It compares the target value with the value at the midpoint of the array.
<br>Three Possible Outcomes:

<br>If the target value is equal to the value at the midpoint, the search is successful, and the index of the midpoint is returned.
<br>If the target value is less than the value at the midpoint, the search continues on the left half of the array (from left to mid - 1), excluding the midpoint.
<br>If the target value is greater than the value at the midpoint, the search continues on the right half of the array (from mid + 1 to right), excluding the midpoint.


<br>Iteration or Recursion: Steps 2-4 are repeated iteratively (using a loop) or recursively (calling the binary search function with updated left and right pointers) on the selected half of the array until the target value is found or the search space is empty.
<br>Termination: If the target value is found, the index of the target is returned. If the search space is empty (i.e., left &gt; right), the target is not present in the array, and the search terminates with a "not found" indication.
<br>In a binary search, all the values must have an order.<br>On average, a binary search performs, at most,  comparisons for  number of elements in an array.<br>int binarySearch(int array[], int size, int value)  
{  
	int first = 0,          // First array element  
		last = size - 1,    // Last array element  
		middle,             // Mid point of search  
		position = -1;      // Position of search value  
		bool found = false; // Flag 
		 
	while (!found &amp;&amp; first &lt;= last)  
	{  
		middle = (first + last) / 2; // Calculate mid point  
		if (array[middle] == value) // If value is found at mid  
		{  
			found = true;  
			position = middle;  
		}  
		else if (array[middle] &gt; value) // If value is in lower half  
			last = middle - 1;

			first = middle + 1; // If value is in upper half

<br><br>There are two types of electric charges: positive and negative.<br>When you have two objects<br>
<br>Of the same charge, they attract one another. This is called electrostatic attraction.
<br>Of different charges, they repel each other. This is called electrostatic repulsion.
<br>Electric charge is measured in coulombs (C).<br>Electric charges have certain properties:<br>
<br>Charge is quantized. In other words, it comes in discrete amounts. The smallest amount of charge an object can have is  which equals .
<br>The magnitude of a charge is independent of its type. In other words, the smallest positive charge is  and the smallest negative charge is .

One side will be positive and the other will be negative.<br>The separation of the positive and negative charges is called polarization. An object that shows polarization is said to be polarized.<br>This results in an electric dipole in the conductor because one side is positive and one side is negative. It also creates a charged object with no transfer of charges. Thus, it has been charged by induction.<br>Grounded: when a conducting wire is run from the sphere to the ground.

<br>Rules for drawing electric field diagrams.<br>
<br>Electric field lines start at positive charges and end at negative charges or go on infinitely.
<br>The number of field lines originating or terminating at a charge is proportional to the magnitude of that charge. For example, a charge of 2q will have twice as many lines as a charge of q.

<br>The electric field is 0 inside conducting material.
<br>Excess charge on an isolated conductor is on the surface.
<br>The electric field is perpendicular to the conductor's surface.
<br>On irregularly shaped conductors, the charge accumulates wherever the radius of the curvature is smallest. The smaller the radius, the more charge accumulates.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Data are collections of observations, like measurements, genders, or survey responses.

<br>"Data" is plural, so it should be "data are" and not "data is."


<br>Statistics involves planning studies, obtaining data, organizing, summarizing, presenting, analyzing, and interpreting data to draw conclusions.
<br>A population is the complete collection of all measurements or data under consideration.
<br>A census collects data from every member of the population.
<br>A sample is a subcollection of members selected from a population.
<br>voluntary response: participants choose to be in study
<br>Steps<br>
<br>Prepare - goal of study? What does the data represent?

<br>Source - Credible? reliable? 
<br>sampling method - random is best. voluntary response comple be al decide it they your to vote


<br>Analyze

<br>graph &amp; explore data 
<br>apply statistical methods


<br>Conclude is there statistical &amp; practical significance.
<br>Voluntary response sample: respondents choose to participate in. Can be biased<br>Statistical significance is not practical significance.<br><br>
<br>Parameter: measures population. Remember using population parameter
<br>Statistic: measures sample. Remember using sample statistic
<br>In statistics, there are two types of data:<br>
<br>Quantitative: numbers represent counts or measurements. This can be further divided into:

<br>Discrete: the number of values in an interval are finite

<br>example: number of fingers on a hand (you can have 1 finger but not have 1.1 fingers!)


<br>Continuous: the number of values in an interval are infinite

<br>example: weight (you can weigh 90 kg or 90.1 kg)




<br>quantitative example: weight, height, number of fingers


<br>Categorical: names or labels. These do not represent anything

<br>Be careful!. It may be coded with numbers


<br>Data can also be classified using levels of measurement. The 4 levels are:<br>
<br>Ratio: There is a natural zero starting point and ratios make sense

<br>Example: height, length, volume, distance

<br>multiplying 90 cm by 2 gives you 180 cm, which is meaningful


<br>To test, see if you can multiply by two and if there's a 0


<br>Interval: Differences are meaningful, but there are no natural zeros or ratios

<br>body temperatures, shoe sizes, years


<br>Ordinal: data is ordered, but differences can't be found or are meaningless

<br>Rankings of colleges, grades
<br>Measures relative, not magnitudes of differences
<br>To tell, ask if you can subtract and still get something meaningful


<br>Nominal: categories only. No order

<br>eye color, sex, gender
<br>Do not do calculations on these


<br>Mnemonic

<br>Nominal: name of categories
<br>Ordinal: order of categories
<br>Ratio: has 0s for measurement. Rati0. Ratios can also be multiplied.
<br>Interval: no 0s for measurement

<br>Big data: large datasets that can't be analyzed using traditional software<br>Data science: using stats, computer science, and software engineering to draw conclusions on data<br>
<br>requires background in stats, computers, and expertise in some other field
<br>missing data for 2 reasons:

<br>random: no reason for missing data
<br>not at random: intentional reason for missing data


<br>Ways to deal with missing data<br>
<br>Delete it (leads to bias for "missing not at random" data)
<br>Impute (substitute) missing values
<br><br>Best is randomness with placebo group<br>
<br>placebo: pill that does nothing
<br>Experiment: apply some treatment and see what happens<br>
<br>generally better than observational studies
<br>Good experiments use<br>
<br>Replication: repeating on more than one individual
<br>Blinding: subject doesn't know if they're getting the treatment or placebo

<br>Double-blind: Neither subjects nor experimenters know who gets placebo or treatment


<br>Randomness: subjects assigned to groups at random. Sampling methods include:

<br>Simple random: randomly choose participants
<br>Systematic: choose every th sample (i.e. every 3rd, 4th, or 5th subject is tested)
<br>Convenience: use data that is easy to get
<br>Stratified: divide population into strata (groups). Choose randomly within each strata
<br>Cluster: divide population into clusters (groups). Randomly select some clusters and select all members in that cluster


<br>Mnemonic
To differentiate sampling methods:

<br>Simple random: random
<br>Systematic: you have a system for choosing (every th time)
<br>Convenience: pick the easiest people
<br>Stratified: "some stratified"
<br>Cluster: cluster = all

<br>Confounding: when there's an effect, but we don't know what the factor is<br>Observational study: look at what happens, but don't do anything to affect the subjects. There are three types:<br>
<br>Retrospective: go back in time and collect data over some period
<br>Cross-sectional: measure at one point in time
<br>Prospective (aka longitudinal or cohort): measure and collect data for the future
<br>Lurking variable: affects other variables in a study, but is not included<br>Sampling errors<br>
<br>Sampling error (aka random sampling error): selected sample deviates from true population result
<br>Nonsampling error: human error
<br>Nonrandom sampling error: using non-random sample (i.e. convenience sample)
<br>Voluntary response: participants choose to participate<br>Designs of experiments<br>
<br>Completely random: randomly decide who gets treatment or placebo
<br>Randomized block: divide subjects into groups. Decide randomly within each group who gets treatment or placebo

<br>Example: divide men and women into groups. Decide randomly within each gender who gets treatment or placebo


<br>Matched pairs: get measurements from same subject before and after an experiment
<br>Proportion: portion of people who meet a certain characteristic.]]></description><link>sta-2023-statistics/01-introduction-to-statistics-sta-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">STA 2023 Statistics/01 Introduction to Statistics - STA 2023.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 15:30:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[02 Visualizing Data - STA 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>Frequency distribution tables tell us how many observations we see for each category.<br>Let's say we have the following table:<br><br>The frequency tells us how many are in each range. For instance, we have 3 scores in between 0 and 9.<br>Classes divide our data into different groups. Classes cannot overlap values. In a table, classes are typically the rows of a table.<br>There is also terminology to describe each class too:<br>
<br>Lower Class Limit (LCL): This is the smallest value within each score range. In the table above, the lower class limits are:

<br>0 for the range 0-9
<br>10 for the range 10-19
<br>20 for the range 20-29
<br>30 for the range 30-39
<br>40 for the range 40-49


<br>Upper Class Limit (UCL): This is the largest value within each score range. In the table above, the upper class limits are:

<br>9 for the range 0-9
<br>19 for the range 10-19
<br>29 for the range 20-29
<br>39 for the range 30-39
<br>49 for the range 40-49


<br>Class Width: This is the range covered by each class.

<br>When constructing tables, the class width is: 
<br>In this table, the class width is 10. If we take the lower class limits of the first two classes and subtract them, we get .


<br>Class Midpoint: The class midpoint is the average value within each range. In this example, the class midpoints are:

<br>4.5 for the range 0-9 (average of 0 and 9)
<br>14.5 for the range 10-19 (average of 10 and 19)
<br>24.5 for the range 20-29 (average of 20 and 29)
<br>34.5 for the range 30-39 (average of 30 and 39)
<br>44.5 for the range 40-49 (average of 40 and 49)


<br>Class Boundaries: Class boundaries are the values that separate one class from the next. To calculate them:

<br>Subtract the upper class limit for the first class from the lower class limit for the second class
<br>Divide the result by 2
<br>Subtract the result from the lower class limit and add the result to the upper class limit
<br>Repeat for the rest of the other classes


<br>In this example, the class boundaries are:

<br>-0.5 to 9.5
<br>9.5 to 19.5
<br>19.5 to 29.5
<br>29.5 to 39.5
<br>39.5 to 49.5




<br>TIP
To speed up the process of finding all these values:

<br>Find the lowest number for each of the values and the class width.
<br>Add the class width until you have finished for all classes

If we use the table as an example, the lowest value for:

<br>The lowest class limit is 0
<br>The upper class limit is 9
<br>The class midpoint is 4.5
<br>The class boundary is -0.5

Since the class width is , add 10 to each of these values to get the next row's numbers. Add 10 to get the one after that. Continue this until you have filled in all the rows.
<br><br><br>Relative frequency distributions calculate the percent that's in each category. To make one:<br>
<br>Find the total number of data points (or total frequency)
<br>Divide the frequency in each class by total frequency
<br>With our example table:<br><br>Relative frequency must always add up to 100% (with a wiggle room of  for rounding errors).<br><br><br>Cumulative frequency distributions add up the total frequency of its class and all previous classes before it. Additionally, it uses the "upper class limit or lower" as its category name.<br><br><br>Histograms allow us to visually see a frequency distribution.<br>There are different ways data can be distributed. Some examples include<br>‚ÄúDistribution of Data.md‚Äù is not created yet. Click to create.<br>Notice that the direction of skew depends on where the "long tail" (where the data is less concentrated) is. The "lump" (place where data concentrates the most) is in the opposite direction of the skew.<br><br>There are two interpretations of data:<br>
<br>Loose: the data roughly resembles this type of distribution
<br>Strict: the data must exactly resemble this type of distributio. Room for error is not allowed.
<br>For example, a "strict" uniform distribution requires that all categories have the exact same number of data points. A "loose" uniform distribution requires that all categories have roughly the same number of data points.<br><br>Scatter plots help you see if two variables are related<br>Correlation tells you how related two variables are (linear).

<br>Mode: most frequent number
<br>Median: middle value when all data is organised greatest to least.

<br>If there are an odd number of values, use the middle number.
<br>If there are an even number of values, find the average of the middle two numbers

 <br><br>In statistics, probability is written with a . Variables can sometimes be encapsulated by parentheses alongside . For instance, writing  is just like saying, "the probability of ."<br><br><br>Tip
When calculating for two simultaneous events, always assume that the first event happened when calculating for the 2nd event.
<br><br>Both events must occur to be considered a successful outcome. It is also known as the "Multiplication Rule".<br>To calculate:<br><br>The  (also known as "cap") means "and".<br>For two or more events:<br>
<br><br>There are two types of replacement:<br>
<br>With replacement: "replace" item back into the group. Once an item is taken out of the pile, it is put back in.

<br>Independent. That means probabilities do not change.


<br>Without replacement: don't "replace" item back in group. Once an item is taken out of the pile, it stays out.

<br>Dependent. That means probabilities do change.


<br>When dealing with "without replacement", subtract the denominator (if it's taken out of the whole group and the numerator (if it's not part of the subgroup).<br>Example
Let's say we want to find the probability of pulling a 2 and a Jack in a standard deck of cards.

In the above problem, we find the probability of drawing a 2 (). After the 2 has been drawn, we calculate the probability of pulling a jack. There are  cards left, and the numerator stays the same because removing a 2 does not affect the number of jacks left (hence, ).
However, if we want to find the probability of pulling 2 Jacks, the answer is slightly different:

This time, pulling one Jack affects the total number left in the deck of cards and the number of Jacks left. That means the numerator (number of jacks) and the denominator change (total cards left) change.
<br><br>At least one event must be true to be considered a successful outcome. It is also known as the "Addition Rule".<br><br>The  (also known as "cup") means "or."<br>As an example,  means a card from a standard deck of cards can be either, red, jack or both to be part of the group. However, red jacks , or , are counted twice, so we need to subtract those from the group.<br>Here's what that looks like as a table:<br><br>As you can see, if we didn't subtract out , we would end up adding it into our totals for Jack and Red!<br>Replacing it with variables gives us:<br><br>Note that  means "not" and  means "sum" or "total."<br>Focusing on only the most important variables gives us:<br><br><br>To calculate 3 or more events:<br><br>In other words, add up all the probabilities for each events happening and subtract any combination of those events happening together so that they aren't counted twice.<br><br>This means it is impossible for two events to happen at the same time. If two events are disjoint, then:<br><br>Example
Having a driver's license vs. not having a driver's license is disjoint. It is impossible to both have and not have a license at the same time.
Another example: you flip a coin and it lands as either heads or tails‚Äînot both. That is impossible.
<br><br>Attention
In my class, complements are represented as . However, I will use  to represent complements.
<br>Complements is the probability that an event will not happen. It can be found using:<br><br><br>To find this, use this formula:<br>where  is the number of samples you want and  means "at least one ."<br>Example
You flip a coin 3 times. There is a 50% chance of tails. What is the probability of having at least one head?
That means . So, the answer is:

<br><br>This finds the probability that event  happens given that event  has already happened. Its equation is:<br><br> is a fancy way of writing " given ".<br>In other words, divide the number of times  and  happen together over the number of times  happens in total.<br>To visualize  and  on a table:<br><br>If we want to find the , then the table now looks like this:<br><br>Now, we can plug numbers into our equation:<br>]]></description><link>sta-2023-statistics/04-probability-sta-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">STA 2023 Statistics/04 Probability - STA 2023.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2024 22:53:13 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[05 Discrete Probability Distributions - STA 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br><br>Probability distributions describe how a random variable is distributed or spread out across different outcomes.<br>Random variables are a number that can represent a quantity or outcome. There are two main types:<br>
<br>Discrete random variable: takes on a countable number of distinct values. They are represented using integers. Examples include:

<br>The outcome of rolling a six-sided die
<br>The number of people in a room


<br>Continuous random variables: takes on any value within a certain range. Examples include:

<br>Height of people
<br>Temperature


<br>Probability distributions example<br><br>To find the  (probability that  equals a certain number), look for the row with that number. For example, to find , just look for the corresponding  value at  ( in this case).<br>To find the  (probability of getting a certain number or higher), add up all the probabilities that satisfy the problem. For example, to find , add up all the probabilities that have an  value .<br><br><br>Significantly high values are given using:<br><br>Likewise, significantly low values are given using:<br><br>In both equations, if the equalities are true, then the result is significant.<br><br>Binomial distributions find the number of successes in a certain number of trials. This assumes that:<br>
<br>There are a fixed number of trials
<br>Trials are independent
<br>There are only 2 outcomes
<br>The probability of success is the same for all trials
<br>Its formula is:<br>
where<br>

<br>Example
Let's assume we roll a dice 5 times for each trial to find the average. The expected value (or population proportion) is:<br>

because that's the value we would expect if we rolled that dice infinite times.
However, since we want to find the sample proportion, we would need to roll it 5 times and get the average for each round. Then, we take the mean of those averages to get our sample proportion. Let's say our averages are  (which we got after rolling our dice 5 times for each average). To find the sample proportion, average the list out:<br>

Last modified: 2024-06-01 18:26:06<br><br><br>This note dictates how I will write. This should be treated as a list of general rules to follow. While I strive to maintain these standards, it should be important to know that I cannot uphold these standards 100% of the time.<br>
<br>Keep paragraphs short. 5 sentences or shorter is ideal.
<br>No long-winded explanations. Be concise.
<br>List out items in a sequence often. This makes it easier to read for everyone.
<br>AI-generated writing is fine, as long as it is clear.
<br>Write for the sake of clarity. This means writing at the 8th grade level or lower. Do not over-complicate anything. After all, no one knows if your writing may become useful in the future.<br>
<br>Define complicated terms, unless those terms were already defined in the pre-requisites.
<br>However, if pre-requisite knowledge is required, it must be stated at the beginning of the document. If the note is part of a larger series, then the introductory note to the series must state what one must know to understand the notes.<br>Assume that your reader is a middle schooler. For niche topics, stating required pre-requisite knowledge may not be needed if the title only appeals to a specific audience.<br>Example

<br>"How to update Ubuntu". We can safely assume that the only people interested in reading this are Linux users.
<br>"Gauss's Law". We can safely assume that the only people interested in reading this are studying electricity or physics. You might need to state that calculus is required.

However, be wary that beginners may try reading your content simply out of interest. For example,

<br>"How to Automate Your Emails". This might attract some beginner programmers, and even ordinary laypeople. Necessary pre-requisite knowledge should be stated at the beginning.

<br><br>Stick to using Markdown standards.<br>Info
Callouts are the main exception. Only use callouts when you want to draw attention to something.
